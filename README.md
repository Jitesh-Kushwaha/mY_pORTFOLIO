Portfolio Website

This repository contains the complete source code for my personal developer & engineering portfolio, built using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript with no frameworks or build tools. The website showcases my work across Robotics, Embedded Systems, Space Technology, DevOps and Software Engineering in a clean, dark GitHub-inspired interface.

The site includes dedicated sections for About Me, Projects, Blogs, Photos, GitHub and Contact, along with a dark ↔ light theme toggle, smooth animations, and a fully responsive design. All projects, blogs and media are rendered dynamically from JavaScript, making the site easy to expand and maintain.

This portfolio is designed to reflect how I work as an engineer — focused on real-world systems like autonomous drones, rocket avionics, telemetry networks, and DevOps pipelines, not just web apps. The UI is inspired by developer platforms like GitHub and modern technical portfolios, delivering a professional, hacker-style aesthetic that matches my engineering mindset.
